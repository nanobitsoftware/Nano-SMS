# Nano-SMS

WINDOWS Program designed to decipher, read, collate, print and much more, for the files that SMS BACKUP AND RETORE create; essentially, backups of text messages, calls, and media.

There are plenty of web based things that can read them, sorta. Most just let you do basic reading. But they all suffer from a big flaw: Bigger files just don't work. You either crash the browser
worker threads, max out your system memory, or the web app just chokes.

I aim for this software to do much more than just read. From printing, selecting, doing things with the media, copying out of, creating html pages, creating reports for law enforcement, and 
much, much more.

For right now, it will be WINDOWS ONLY, but I am writing it in a way that will allow me to port it to other systems quite easily. I plan for console version of it to come soon after beta 1. Windows
will have the GUI. Also, since my code tends to stay very close to the standards, and I don't use libraries, my programs tend to run exceptionally well inside WINE on Linux and MacoS. Food for thought.



Right now, everything is raw as the foundation is being built. Once the foundations and data structures are all set up, the real fun begins.

If you would like to help with this, or have any questions, you may write to me here, or email me at mike @ [nanobit].net using the subject "REGARDING NANO-SMS".


I am in no way affiliated, endorsed, sponsored, I do not own any part thereof, or program for the maker of SMS BACKUP AND RESTORE. I just respect their product and wish to make a program for those with
larger backup files to use them efficiently.

I will update this read me soon and make it prettier with lots of more information.

Thanks,
Mike.
